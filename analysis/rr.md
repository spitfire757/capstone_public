# ARIMA Analysis Step-by-Step Guide

## Step 1: Understand Your Data
- **Objective**: Ensure that the data is a time series, meaning it is recorded at regular intervals (daily, monthly, etc.).
  
- **Check for Seasonality/Trends**: 
  - Plot the data to visually inspect patterns such as trends, seasonality, or noise.
  
  > **Why?** ARIMA models assume the data is stationary. If your data has trends or seasonality, further steps may be needed to make it stationary.

## Step 2: Check for Stationarity
- **Stationarity**: A stationary time series has constant mean and variance over time.
  
- **Methods**: Use statistical tests like:
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test 
  - KPSS test

> **If not stationary**: Differencing (subtracting the value at the previous time step) may be necessary to remove trends.

## Step 3: Make the Data Stationary
- **Differencing**: If your data has trends or seasonality, apply differencing (e.g., first difference) to remove these components. This transforms the series into a stationary form.

### Tips:
- First differencing is often enough to make the series stationary.
- Seasonal differencing can be applied for seasonal data.

## Step 4: Identify ARIMA Parameters (p, d, q)
- **AR (Autoregressive term, p)**: Number of lag observations to include.
  - Use the **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)** plot to determine this value.
  
- **I (Integrated term, d)**: Number of times the data needs to be differenced to achieve stationarity.
  - If you differenced once, then `d = 1`.

- **MA (Moving Average term, q)**: Number of lagged forecast errors to include.
  - Use the **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** plot to determine this value.

## Step 5: Fit the ARIMA Model
- After identifying the parameters `(p, d, q)`, fit the ARIMA model to your data.
  - **ARIMA(p, d, q)**: Choose the optimal values of `p`, `d`, `q` based on your analysis.

## Step 6: Validate the Model
- **Residual Analysis**: After fitting the model, check the residuals (errors) to ensure there’s no pattern.
  
  > If the residuals are random, the model is likely a good fit.

- Plot residuals or use statistical tests to confirm they behave like white noise.

## Step 7: Forecasting
- Once the model is validated, use it to make future predictions.
  
- Forecast future values and compare them against actual observations (if available) to assess the model’s accuracy.

## Step 8: Evaluate Model Performance
- Compare the predicted values with actual values using metrics like:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

### Tip:
- You can adjust the ARIMA parameters based on the model's performance to improve accuracy.
