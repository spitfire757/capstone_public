    "### What I need to do to get a working heat map ###\n",
    "    - A \"box\" (grid) With 4 corners and data in the 4 corneres\n",
    "    - The data inside the grid will then be linereally interpolated (Possibly Voronoi)\n",
    "    - A heatmap of the data over the grid will then be generated on a predetermiend timeframe (hour / day)\n",
    "    - Oncce all of those images are created I will have a working 'radar' map similar to goal.gif\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems with Doing this efficiently ###\n",
    "    - Quality of data : How can I make sure the data is different enough to show a heat map \n",
    "    - REsolution : This will be saved as a gif, but will run on a small server, need to keep size down\n",
    "    - Grid Size : Similar to Resolution, I need a predeterimed distance from a center (lat, lon) that will create the bounding box\n",
    "        - HAVE to make sure the data exists    \n",
    "### Ideas ###\n",
    "    - Each of the 5 points (4 bounding, 1 in middle) will have data values from the openmeteo interpolater But I can cross dived into \n",
    "        even more points acorss lat and lon vals. Which can increase resolution for a still image or even giv (resource dependant)\n",
    "        Point in middle is point 1 Then treat as book page for subpoints\n",
